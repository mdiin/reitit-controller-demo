## Running in development ##

Run:

```bash
clj -A:dev:test:shadow-cljs rcd
```

This starts up shadow-cljs with a socket REPL, to which you can connect your editor.

### Atom with Chlorine:

1. Connect a Clojure Socket REPL in Atom
2. Start the system from the `rcd.system` namespace
3. Open the webserver URL in a browser
4. Connect an Embedded REPL in Atom

This will give you a Clojure REPL and a Clojurescript browser-connected REPL.

## Developing
